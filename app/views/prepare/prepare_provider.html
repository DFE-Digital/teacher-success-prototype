                    Your training provider will help you develop your teaching knowledge and theory ready for you to put into practise in your placements. 
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    They’ll help you gather your evidence to show you meet their initial teacher training curriculum so you can achieve qualified teacher status (QTS). 
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Before you start your training, you might want to think about things to ask when you start.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Your provider will work closely with your placement school to get you set up appropriately for your placement. 
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You may want to talk to them about what’s expected for you to provide – for example, will you need to bring your own laptop? 
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You’ll likely need access to school systems on your placement, for example, to access planning materials, pupil information or to record homework. You may also need a school email account setting up.                                 
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    How should you access the school building? Is there a signing in and out process? If you’re travelling by car, is there parking available? What are the timings of the school day? Is there a dress code?  
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You may have to commute to your placement school – you should talk to your provider about any financial support available. 
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If you’re ill during your training, it’s important to know how you should communicate this with both your placement school and training provider. 
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    It’s important to let the right person know as soon as possible so any cover can be arranged.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Each school will have their own safeguarding policies and health and safety procedures. If you know which placement school you’re going to, you may want to check their website to familiarise yourself with their policies. 
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You’ll likely receive safeguarding training from your provider or your school. 
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    It’s likely you’ll need to bring ID with you on your first day – this might include your DBS. 
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You may also want to familiarise yourself with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">Department for Education’s keeping children safe in education guidance</a>.

                    Part of the <a href="">teachers’ standards</a> you’ll be assessed against at the end of your course include your professional conduct.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    This will be an important part of being in the classroom and joining the school environment as a member of staff. Think about the dress code and how you might conduct yourself both in the classroom and out, like in the staffroom.                 
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If you need support during your training, you should talk to your school and provider about any reasonable adjustments you may need in place ahead of time. 
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>aadjusting your timetable to suit your needs  </li>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Each school will have different policies and these could be different from the methods your training provider teaches.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You should talk to your placement school about their specific behaviour policies.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                   Your placement school might use specific lesson planning resources that you’ll be able to access. 
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You will not have to worry about planning any lessons straight away as you’ll start to grow your teaching responsibilities slowly. But it might be useful to know what you’ll have access to when the time comes.

                    As well as preparing for your first placement, you can also think about what to ask your teacher training provider before you start your course.
