                    An important part of your teacher training will be learning how to plan lessons. 
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You’ll likely have the opportunity to do this alongside your mentor or another class teacher.

                    Your placement school or provider may provide you with supportive materials for this and may require you to use specific templates.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    All lesson planning should consider the national curriculum. The national curriculum sets out the programmes of study and attainment targets for all subjects at all 4 key stages.                 
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    All local-authority-maintained schools in England must teach these programmes of study.

                    You might want to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum">read the national curriculum (link opens in new tab)</a> for your key stage or subject to help you understand what you’ll be teaching. 
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You can also look at your placement school’s website to understand what is covered on their specific curriculum and how they implement this.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Assessment for learning is how you’re measuring the progress of the students in your lessons.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                   You need to know if your students have understood what you’ve just taught them and how you can assess this as part of your lesson.

                    Adaptive teaching is how you adjust your teaching if your students have not understood something.

                    Some schools will use specific schemes of work – this is where each lesson is part of a wider, structured plan of how subjects will be delivered.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Schemes of work operate as a roadmap for teachers to help them plan and deliver lessons consistently.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You should talk to your placement school about any schemes they follow.
